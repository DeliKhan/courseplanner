ðŸ“š## Course Planner For McMaster ðŸ“š
Have you spent alot of time looking through your courses, planning out which to take in what year in order to take the courses you want? Or maybe you realize when enrolling for a course you want or need that you don't have the pre-requisites? This website is designed to help you easily plan out the best way to organize your schedule, so that you are eligible for the courses you want to take.

This website uses your program name to determine the required courses and then takes your preference on what courses you want and don't want. Then, by representing each course and its pre-requisites and anti-requisites as a node, it creates a graph in which it runs topological sort to find the most effective path that ensures no course conflicts!
